<h1>Howdy</h1>
<p>
    I enjoyed the CMA CGM visit very much, especially the discussion covering the SmartShip technology. I have heard of CMA CGM before,
    and I was slightly confused as to why we were visiting a shipping and logistics company. However, this presented a great opportunity
    to visualize how cloud computing works at an enterprise level whereas we have been working on strictly a personal level. I enjoyed
    the discussion on the importance of the speed and accuracy of analytics like the hull and propeller fouling and a glimpse into how
    much money is at risk when these systems are not implemented with care. It gave a great idea of how important cloud computing is because
    computing all of this data locally would be hard to manage and scale with their extremely large fleet. Overall, this helped me to 
    better appreciate how I might interact with cloud computing in industry, and just how much of an impact it has in daily operations.
